For this question, I have used the approach similar to longest increasing subsequence. In this, the length of sequence count is incremented only if it is greater than current value or no value has been added. Ultimately the maximum of picked or no picked is taken, so as to maximise the length of subsequence. Hence, it gives out the longest subsequence which corresponds to  the length of the longest strictly increasing echo pathpath
